# Synthinon

A simple synth implemented using the Web Audio API.

Keyboard, basic operations and some ideas came from this [How to code a playable synth keyboard](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-code-a-playable-synth-keyboard/) blog:

This one ([Web audio delay](https://tomhazledine.com/web-audio-delay/)) was also very helpful.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
